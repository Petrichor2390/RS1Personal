Launch Files\+:

SLO3-\/2mapping.\+launch\+: launches all programs required to create a map of the smart factory world. use the teleop keyboard to move the platform around and generate the map using nav2

SLO3-\/5path\+Planning.\+launch\+: launches programs required to navigate the turtlebot around the environment using nav2goal button in r\+Vis, make sure the use the localisation button to tell the robot where it is before setting goals

SLO3-\/6object\+Exclude.\+launch\+: launches the robot in the gazebo world where you can manually move the robot and the cylinder around. When code detects the cylinder it will stop looking and generate a map with the cylinder overlaid.

dependancies\+: smart\+\_\+factory package (\href{https://github.com/AbhinashTiwary0509/RS1}{\texttt{ https\+://github.\+com/\+Abhinash\+Tiwary0509/\+RS1}})
